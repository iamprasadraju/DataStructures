# Sorting

**Sorting** refers to the process of arranging the elements of a collection—such as an array, list, or other data structure—into a specific order, typically ascending or descending. This ordering makes it easier to search, analyze, or display data.

## Why Sorting Matters ?

- Efficient Searching: Sorted data allows for faster searching algorithms, such as binary search.

- Data Organization: Sorting helps present data in a meaningful way, making it easier to interpret.

- Preparation for Other Algorithms: Many algorithms require sorted data as a prerequisite.



# Common Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithm         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Selection Sort    | Repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the front. |
| Insertion Sort    | Builds a sorted section by inserting each new element into its proper place.  |
| Bubble Sort       | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.            |
| Merge Sort        | Recursively divides the data, sorts each part, and merges them back together. |
| Quick Sort        | Partitions data around a pivot and sorts partitions recursively.              |
| Heap Sort         | Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.                           |
| Bucket/Radix Sort | Groups elements by digits or buckets, then sorts within groups.               |
