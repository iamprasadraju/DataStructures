-  **Linear Data Structures**:

    Data elements are arranged sequentially in a single level, where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a straight line. They allow traversal of elements in a single, linear run. This structure is generally easier to implement and understand. 

    Ex:- Arrays, Linked lists, stacks, and queues

    * They are suitable for simple, ordered data storage and manipulation tasks.


- Non-linear Data Structures:

    Data elements are arranged hierarchically or in complex networks, spanning multiple levels. Elements can have relationships with multiple other elements, requiring traversal methods like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). These structures are more complex to implement but utilize memory efficiently and model complex relationships well.

    Ex:- Trees, Graphs etc..

    * They are ideal for applications involving hierarchical data, complex relationships, or multiple levels, such as social networks, file systems, and artificial intelligence.
